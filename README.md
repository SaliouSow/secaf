Africa SecLists - Defensive Cyber Tools for the Region

This SecLists collection is dedicated exclusively to defensive and educational cybersecurity purposes. It aims to strengthen the protection of systems, networks, and data against growing threats in Africa, particularly in West Africa (Guinea, Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, etc.).

**African Context**
Local Threats: Designed to test resilience against common attacks like banking phishing, ransomware targeting SMEs, and intrusions into critical infrastructure (telecoms, energy, governments).

**Objectives:** Help sysadmins, ethical pentesters, and SOC teams identify vulnerabilities before attackers strike. Aligned with standards like ISO 27001 and NIST.

**Recommended Use:** Defensive scans (Nessus, OpenVAS), certification training (CompTIA Security+, CEH), and hardening Linux/Windows servers in virtual environments.

**Warning:** Offensive use strictly prohibited. Comply with local laws (e.g., Guinean cybersecurity regulations) and always obtain written authorization. Not responsible for misuse.

Contributions welcome to enrich lists tailored to the African context (local weak passwords, regional payloads).
